      <h2>What is a Portfolio?</h2>

<p>A portfolio is a curated collection of 3-5 projects, often presented as a website. It showcases your skills, process(es), and problem-solving abilities. Your portfolio is an opportunity to highlight your growth, creativity, and unique approach to solving problems. A strong portfolio emphasizes your thinking process, storytelling, and the real-world impact of your work. Employers and clients use portfolios to assess your qualifications and determine if you're a good fit for their team or project. </p>

<h2>Components of a Portfolio</h2>
<ul>
<li>Home Page </li>
<li>About Me Page</li>
<li>Case Studies</li>
<li>Resume</li>
<li>LinkedIn</li>
<li>Art, Graphic Design, Other</li>

      <h2>General Portfolio Guidelines:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use templates: You can customize and personalize your portfolio to reflect your design style, personality, and or unique brand. You do not need to code your own portfolio.
</li><li>When in-progress: Don't label “in progress”, keep the section/page unpublished while editing, outline next steps/anticipated next steps, and make sure pages are complete enough so someone can understand before publishing.
</li><li>Use clear and direct navigation: Less text/ paragraphs and easy navigation on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
</li><li>No clip art or unrelated stock images: Develop unique visuals from your work!
</li><li>Animation/ Motion: Should only be purposefully used and can be turned off for accessibility purposes.
</li><li>Proofread: Individually and with a friend, classmate, or family member.
</li><li>Verbiage: When describing U-M programs or events (i.e. UMSI Design Jams), use common terms and methods in the field (i.e. design challenge or design sprint).
</li>
